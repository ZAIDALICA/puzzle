travis integration for node.js

Because this specific file is so vital, it is mandatory that you place it in the root of your project folder and that you also validate it, either via the Travis-CLI or via their WebLint.

Second, lets create our hello.js file by pasting the following code:

var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  res.end('Hello Travis!\n')
}).listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/');

Define The Test
Previously we have mentioned that Travis runs all the tests automatically. But how does it know where the tests are? Which files to run?

That is in the package.json file. This file has a scripts element, where you can specify the test command, which Travis will look for and run!

Create a package.json file and paste the following:

{
  "name": "learn-travis-YOURNAME",
  "description": "Simple Travis-CI check for JSHint (Code Linting)",
  "author": "your name here :-)",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "devDependencies": {
    "jshint": "^2.6.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jshint hello.js"
  }
}
